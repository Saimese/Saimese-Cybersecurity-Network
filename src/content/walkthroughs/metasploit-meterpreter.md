## Things You Should Know

### **1. Introduction to Meterpreter**

* Meterpreter is an **advanced payload** in Metasploit that runs **in-memory** on the target.
* It allows **post-exploitation tasks** without leaving files on the target system.
* Supports multiple **platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, PHP, Python, Java.

---

### **2. Meterpreter Flavors**

* **Payload types**:

  * **Staged** – Sent in two parts (small stager first, then full payload).
  * **Inline/Single** – Sent in one step.
* **Choosing a payload** depends on:

  1. **Target OS** – Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.
  2. **Available components** – Python, PHP, Java installed on the target.
  3. **Network constraints** – TCP, HTTPS, IPv4/IPv6 access.
* Use `msfvenom --list payloads | grep meterpreter` to see available Meterpreter versions.
* Some exploits (like **MS17-010 EternalBlue**) have default Meterpreter payloads, but you can use `show payloads` to find compatible alternatives.

---

### **3. Meterpreter Commands**

#### **Help & Categories**

* `help` or `?` lists commands, which fall into categories:

  1. **Core commands** – manage sessions, load extensions, background scripts.
  2. **File system commands** – browse, upload/download, search, edit files.
  3. **Networking commands** – view interfaces, connections, ARP table, port forwarding.
  4. **System commands** – execute programs, view processes, get user info, migrate, reboot/shutdown, shell.
  5. **Other commands** – webcam, microphone, keylogging, screenshots, privilege escalation, password dumping.

---

#### **Common Core Commands**

* `getuid` – Shows the user Meterpreter is running as (privilege level).
* `ps` – Lists running processes and their PIDs.
* `migrate <PID>` – Move Meterpreter to another process for stability or keylogging.
* `sessions` – Switch between multiple Meterpreter sessions.
* `background` – Send current session to the background.
* `exit` – Close the session.

---

#### **File & Search Commands**

* `ls` / `cd` / `pwd` – Navigate filesystem.
* `search -f <filename>` – Find files (e.g., flags, configs).
* `upload` / `download` – Transfer files to/from target.
* `edit` – Modify files directly.

---

#### **Networking Commands**

* `ifconfig` – Show network interfaces.
* `netstat` – List active network connections.
* `route` – View or modify routing table.
* `portfwd` – Forward local ports to target services.

---

#### **System & Post-Exploitation**

* `hashdump` – Dumps Windows SAM database (NTLM password hashes). Can be used for **Pass-the-Hash attacks**.
* `shell` – Opens a system shell on the target. Return with CTRL+Z.
* `clearev` – Clear event logs.
* `getsystem` – Attempt privilege escalation to SYSTEM.
* `keyscan_start/stop/dump` – Record and view keystrokes.
* `screenshare`, `screenshot`, `webcam_snap`, `webcam_stream`, `record_mic` – Capture desktop, webcam, or audio.

---

#### **Post-Exploitation Notes**

* Migrating to the right process is key for **stability and privilege management**.
* Use `getuid` and `ps` first to plan actions.
* Hashes, files, and credentials gathered can aid in lateral movement and further exploitation.
* Commands available may vary depending on target OS, Meterpreter version, and installed components.

---

#### **Key Tips**

* Always start with `help` to see available commands for your Meterpreter version.
* Use `search` to locate sensitive files quickly.
* Be cautious when migrating to lower-privileged processes to avoid losing SYSTEM access.
* Meterpreter is stealthy and flexible, perfect for **post-exploitation** in CTFs or pentesting labs.
