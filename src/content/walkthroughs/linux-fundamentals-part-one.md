|Symbol|Description|
|---|---|
|&|This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.|
|&&|This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.|
|>|This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.|
|>>|This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).|
