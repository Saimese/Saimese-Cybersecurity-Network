### CAPA Results

**MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)**

This framework functions as a strategic playbook that provides detailed insights into attackers methods from gaining initial access to maintaining a presence, escalating priviledges, evading defenses, moving laterally within a network, and more.

**MAEC (Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization)**

This is a specialized language designed to encode and communicate complex details concerning malware that contains a wide variety of attributes, including behaviors, artefacts, and interconnections among various instances of malware.

The table below shows the most commonly used MAEC values by CAPA

|MAEC Value|Description|
|Launcher|Exhibits behaviors that trigger specific actions similar to malware behavior|
|Downloader|Exhibits Behaviors wherein it downloads and execute other files, usually seen on more complex malware|

### Malware Behavior Catalogue (MBC)

The MBC is designed to support various aspects of malware analysis, such as labelling, similarity analysis, and standardized reporting. Its basically a catalogue of malware objectives and behaviors.
