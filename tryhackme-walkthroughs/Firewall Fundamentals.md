## Things You Should Know

A Firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic on a device. It simply acts as a security guard, making sure that unwanted data/traffic is blocked from entering or leaving your network, system, or device. Many modern Firewalls offer extra protection beyond filtering.

### Types of Firewalls
**Stateless Firewall**
- This is the simplest firewall with basic filtering, no tracking of previous connections, data tracking based on predetermined rules, and efficiency on high-speed networks. It operates on layer 3 and 4 of the OSI model.

**Stateful Firewall**
- This Firewall is a bit smarter. It recognizes traffic by patterns, applies complex rules, monitors network connections, and stores data such as previous connections. It operates on layer 3 and 4 of the OSI model.
  
**Proxy Firewall**
- Proxy Firewalls can inspect the data inside the packets, provide content filtering options, provide application control, and decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS data packets in addition to all of the previous Firewall's functions. It operates on layer 7 of the OSI model.
  
**Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**
- Next-Generation Firewalls are the most advanced firewalls. They provide advanced threat protection, come with an intrusion prevention system, identify anomalies based on heuristic analysis, and decrypt and inspect SLL/TLS data packets. It operates on layers 3-7 of the OSI model.

### Basic Components of a Firewalls Rule

**Source Address:** IP address that originates traffic

**Destination Address:** IP address that recieves data/traffic

**Port:** Port number Traffic is recieved/sent through

**Protocol:** The protocol that would be used during the communication

**Action:** What action does the rule take after identifying any traffic of a certain nature?

**Direction:** Will this rule be applied to incoming or outgoing traffic?

### Types of Actions

**Allow:** When Allow is placed in a rule, the rule will permit certain incoming or outgoing traffic.

**Deny:** When Deny is placed in a rule, the rule will block certain incoming or outgoing traffic.

**Forward:** When Forward is placed in a rule, the rule will redirect traffic to a different network segment.

### Directions of Rules

**Inbound Rules:** An inbound rule will apply to incoming traffic. For example, You can allow incoming HTTP traffic from Port 80 on your web server

**Outbound Rules:** An Outbound rule will apply to outgoing traffic. For example, you can block all outgoing SMTP traffic on port 25 from all devices except the mail server

**Forward Rules:** A Forward rule will move specific traffic inside a network. For example, you can forward incoming HTTP traffic on port 80 to the web server on your network.

### Linux iptables Firewall

**Netfilter**

Netfilter is the framework inside Linux OS with core firewall functions. There are various firewall utilities that use Netfilter as a foundation to control network traffic. Some examples are:
- **iptables:** The most widely used utility in many Linux distributions that uses Netfilter framework to give a variety of functions to control network traffic.
- **nftables:** The successor to iptables with enhanced packet filtering and NAT capabilities.
- **firewalld:** This utility has predefined rules and works differently than the other utilities since it comes with different pre-built network zone configurations.

**ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)**
ufw is a firewall with the Netfilter framework on Linux that eliminates the complicated syntax it takes to make rules on iptables and nftables. It gives users an easier, beginner-friendly interface.
